# Architecture of Totem AI

Totem AI is structured as a modular, scalable platform designed to process user inputs and generate AI-powered avatars.  

## Key Components:
1. **Preprocessing Layer**: Cleans and validates user input.
2. **AI Models**:
   - **Avatar Generator**: Generates the avatar based on input parameters.
   - **Style Transfer**: Applies styles and aesthetic modifications to avatars.
3. **Postprocessing Layer**: Refines the generated avatars for output.
